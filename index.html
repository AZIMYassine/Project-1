            Guy Babcock vividly remembers the chilly Saturday evening when he
            discovered the stain on his family. It was September 2018. He, his
            wife and their young son had just returned to their home in Beckley,
            an English village outside of Oxford. Mr. Babcock still had his coat
            on when he got a frantic call from his father.
          </p>
           <p class="primary--text">
            “I don’t want to upset you, but there is some bad stuff on the
            internet,” Mr. Babcock recalled his father saying. Someone,
            somewhere, had written terrible things online about Guy Babcock and
            his brother, and members of their 86-year-old father’s social club
            had alerted him.
          </p>
          <p class="primary--text">
            Mr. Babcock, a software engineer, got off the phone and Googled
            himself. The results were full of posts on strange sites accusing
            him of being a thief, a fraudster and a pedophile. The posts listed
            Mr. Babcock’s contact details and employer.
          </p>

          <p class="primary--text">
            The images were the worst: photos taken from his LinkedIn and
            Facebook pages that had “pedophile” written across them in red type.
            Someone had posted the doctored images on Pinterest, and Google’s
            algorithms apparently liked things from Pinterest, and so the
            pictures were positioned at the very top of the Google results for
            “Guy Babcock.”

            A lawyer, Christina Wallis, wrote about becoming a target of online
            harassment by Ms. Atas.Credit...The New York Times
          </p>

          <p class="primary--text">
            Mr. Babcock searched Ms. Atas’s name online and found a blog written
            by a Canadian lawyer, Christina Wallis. It was the first in a trail
            of clues that would eventually reveal the breadth of Ms. Atas’s
            online campaign.
          </p>

          <p class="primary--text">
            “A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is
            putting on its shoes,” wrote Ms. Wallis, borrowing a quote often
            attributed to Mark Twain. She described how Ms. Atas had waged an
            online campaign against her, her colleagues and her family,
            including branding them pedophiles. Mr. Babcock got goose bumps.
          </p>

          <p class="primary--text">
            His brother-in-law, Mr. Groleau, contacted Ms. Wallis. She had
            represented a bank that foreclosed on two properties Ms. Atas owned
            in the early 2000s. Dozens of people had come under online attack:
            employees of the bank, lawyers who represented the bank, lawyers who
            represented those lawyers, relatives of those people and on and on.
            The attacks seemed engineered to perform well in search engines, and
            they included the victims’ names, addresses, contact information and
            employers. (Ms. Atas denies being the author of many of these
            posts.)

            Puberty, curfews, fights with parents: Adolescence is hard enough
            without having to face down a Gorgon. Perseus has his work cut out
            for him.
          </p>
          <p class="primary--text">
            In the delightful new eight-part audio series “Live From Mount
            Olympus,” a classic Greek myth is translated into a story for teens
            — and for adults who fancy a lively reimagining of the tales they
            learned in English class.
          </p>
          <p class="primary--text">
            Presented by the Onassis Foundation and PRX’s TRAX podcast network,
            and produced with the Brooklyn theater ensemble TEAM, “Live From
            Mount Olympus” tells the tale of Perseus, the demigod hero who
            killed Medusa, the Gorgon with deadly peepers and a reptilian
            hairdo.
          </p>
          <p class="primary--text">
            This Perseus, though, isn’t the macho beefcake hero often portrayed
            in artworks and other adaptations of the story; here, he is an eager
            and naïve young man just figuring out his destiny. When he can focus
            enough to do so, that is. Divine Garland plays the excitable demigod
            with boyish charm and touches of the same brand of arrogance the
            Greeks loved to grant their mighty male protagonists.
          </p>

          <p class="primary--text">
            Perseus must travel to the far reaches of the human world to battle
            Medusa; good thing he’s got gods on his side. Libby King’s Athena,
            goddess of war and wisdom, comes off as an exasperated older sister
            — well, half sister, as she pointedly reminds Perseus, who is also a
            child of Zeus. “Let’s not get carried away, mortal,” she says,
            clearly irked by their kinship.

            Open-armed, fleet-footed: André De Shields plays the messenger god
            Hermes in “Mount Olympus,” as he did in “Hadestown.”Credit...Erik
            Tanner for The New York Times
          </p>

          <p class="primary--text">
            Directed by Rachel Chavkin (“Hadestown”) and Zhailon Levingston
            (“Tina: The Tina Turner Musical”), “Mount Olympus” is an accessible
            entryway into mythology. Running just about 15 to 20 minutes each,
            the episodes (written by Alexie Basil and Nathan Yungerberg) are
            snappy yet satisfying; the dialogue is set at a contemporary clip,
            with modern-day language. “Oh my godsss,” Perseus exclaims
            repeatedly, like a teen running into his crush at the mall.
          </p>

          <p class="primary--text">
            The grittier bits of the stories (violence, assault) are softened
            and maneuvered around gracefully without losing a sense of the
            problematic relationships and themes at work, especially when it
            comes to gender.
          </p>

          <p class="primary--text">
            David Schulman’s appropriately cartoonish sound design rises to the
            pep of the action and gameness of the dialogue, like the shuffle and
            flutter of Hermes making a hasty exit (he has to check on his
            “godcast” subscribers; popularity comes with a cost). And speaking
            of cartoons, this may be an audio production, but Jason Adam
            Katzenstein — whose often punny, sometimes droll and always comic
            illustrations make regular appearances in The New Yorker — provides
            eye-catching art for each episode.

            Part filmmaker, part self-taught cook, Andrew Rea is the mind behind
            the Babish Culinary Universe, a YouTube channel best known as the
            home of his cooking show “Binging With Babish.”
          </p>
          <p class="primary--text">
            Each week, he treats over eight million subscribers to recipes
            derived from cinematic classics, cartoons, cult hits and beyond.
            (Even the show’s title has a TV pedigree; Oliver Babish was a
            character on “The West Wing.”) With the camera focused on his
            tattooed arms, agile fingers and wooden countertop work space, Mr.
            Rea gives step-by-step instructions on making bites like cannoli à
            la “The Godfather,” Hobbit-sized elevenses from “The Lord of the
            Rings” and bacon pancakes from “Adventure Time.”
          </p>
          <p class="primary--text">
            But for an on-camera chef who makes dishes inspired by movies,
            sitcoms, anime and more, Mr. Rea, 33, is surprisingly tuned out. “I
            don’t have time to do much TV watching,” he said. Indeed, the lion’s
            share of his schedule is devoted to planning recipes, filming and
            editing, all on the two lower levels of his six-floor home in the
            Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn.
          </p>
          <p class="primary--text">
            “The vast majority of ideas for the show come from suggestions” by
            commenters, Mr. Rea said, “often from things I haven’t seen. I
            definitely try to vet things when people suggest them, but sometimes
            I have to watch things that I specifically don’t want to watch.”

            <b>12:30 p.m.</b> We’ve stopped at McDonald’s, and I’m indulging in
            the first 10-piece chicken nuggets with fries that I’ve had in well
            over a year. It feels like I can taste colors.

          <p class="primary--text">
            <b>3 p.m.</b> We’re back at my home/studio after fighting tooth and
            nail for a terrible parking spot two blocks away. Very disappointed
            to come downstairs to a 55-degree studio. One heating vent was
            closed, and the other was apparently covered with a box. As I start
            laying down the voice-over, I’m wearing a goose down jacket and
            straddling a heat lamp.

          <p class="primary--text">
            <b>4 p.m.</b> I realize that, due to some technical glitches, I have
            some 24-frame-per-second footage recorded in 60 frames per second.
            Basically, that means my footage looks choppy. I attempt to find
            workarounds and realize I can apply speed ramps to the footage to
            make it look semi-normal, bringing my workload down to about four
            hours instead of, like, 20.
